# AI Playlist Generator ‚Äì House of Playlist

A simple AI tool that turns mood-based text input (like ‚Äúhype gym workout‚Äù or ‚Äúchill study vibe‚Äù) into a custom Spotify playlist ‚Äî using only **genre search** due to Spotify API limitations.

---

## Features

- Text-based mood detection (e.g., `"rainy breakup"`, `"happy picnic"`)
- Heuristic mapping of moods to Spotify-supported genres
- Playlist generation via **Spotify Search API** (not recommendations)
- Two interfaces:
  - ‚úÖ `Streamlit` for interactive browser use
  - ‚úÖ `Command Line` for quick testing

## Spotify API Limitations (As of May 2025)

Due to recent deprecations by Spotify:

| Deprecated Feature          | Status             | Impact                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/recommendations` endpoint | üî¥ Deprecated      | Cannot generate playlists using valence/energy directly |
| `/audio-features` endpoint  | üî¥ Deprecated/403s | Cannot filter tracks based on audio features            |
| `/search` endpoint          | ‚úÖ Still Supported | Used to find songs by genre                             |

As a result, our app now uses only **genre-based filtering**, which is less accurate than audio features but still functional.
